# Sakila-Database
I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals

**Description**

In this project, I queried the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.


**Note:** This is a "fake" database that was generated purposely as part of my assessment for the Udacity Nanodegree course, Programming for Data Science with Python .
